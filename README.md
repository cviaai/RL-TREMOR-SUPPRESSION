# RL-TREMOR-SUPPRESSION
System-software phantom for tremor suppression by using reinforcement learning

The code contains the environments for the reinforcement learning model. The first environment works with a physical model. The second environment works with a virtual model written on the base of the [OpenSim](https://opensim.stanford.edu).

## Physical Part

### Requirements

* Python 3.7
* [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) - open-source library for making gyms
* [pySerial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) - library for communication between Arduino and Python
* [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) - library with implemented reinforcement learning algorithms
